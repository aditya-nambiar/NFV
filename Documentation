Modules created:
1. UE/eNodeB  ->	Radio Access Network(RAN)
2. MME        ->	Mobility Management Entity
3. HSS        ->	Home Subscriber Server		
4. SGW        ->	Serving Gateway
5. PGW        ->  PacketDataNetwork(PDN) Gateway

Mapping of programs to modules:
ran.cpp = UE/eNodeB
mme.cpp = MME
hss.cpp = HSS
sgw.cpp = SGW
pgw.cpp = PGW

User Equipment Registration Process:

1. Process of Authentication
	
Step-1:	RAN(UE) sends request to MME with its IMSI, MSISDN and type(1).
Step-2:	MME checks the type. If it is 1, it will forward the entire message to the HSS.
Step-3:	HSS collects the data(autn, rand) for this UE(IMSI, MSISDN) based on the timestamp the request is received and calculates the RES based on the key value for this UE. 
Step-4:	HSS sends the collection of data(autn, rand, res) to MME.
Step-5:	MME saves the res value and forwards the data(autn, rand) to RAN.
Step-6:	RAN calculates the res value based on the same key that HSS has and sends this res value to MME.
Step-7:	MME now verifies this res value with the res value obtained from the HSS. If they match. it sends OK reply. Otherwise, it does not reply anything.
Step-8:	If UE gets OK reply, then the authentication of UE is successful, otherwise not.
